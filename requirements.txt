# PyTorch Geometric dependencies (like torch_scatter)
# Samesh might need these indirectly via dependencies or the SAM2 submodule.
# Installation often requires specific commands based on PyTorch/CUDA version.
# Please follow the official instructions at: https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/installation.html
# Example commands (CHECK YOUR VERSIONS!):
# pip install torch_scatter torch_sparse torch_cluster torch_spline_conv -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-${TORCH}+${CUDA}.html
# (Replace ${TORCH} with your PyTorch version like 2.3.0 and ${CUDA} with your CUDA version like cu118 or cu121 or cpu)

# If you encounter issues, consider pinning versions closer to the ones specified in
# ComfyUI-Sam-Mesh/samesh-main/samesh-main/pyproject.toml

# Add dependencies here
# You might need to specify a specific samesh version or installation method
# e.g., git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/samesh.git or similar
# samesh # Placeholder - Check samesh installation instructions 

# Core ComfyUI dependencies (if any - add if needed)

# SamMesh dependencies
# Install samesh separately from its directory:
# cd ComfyUI-Sam-Mesh/samesh-main/samesh-main
# pip install -e . 
# Or from the workspace root:
# pip install -e ComfyUI-Sam-Mesh/samesh-main/samesh-main

# Direct dependencies needed by the nodes themselves (besides samesh)
# We already added torch/torchvision/torchaudio, but samesh specifies exact versions.
# It's often best to align versions if possible, but ComfyUI might have its own requirements.
# Let's keep the original torch entries for now, but be aware of potential conflicts.
